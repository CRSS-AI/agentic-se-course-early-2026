They report improvements on holdout sets for both Claude Sonnet 4.6 and GLM-5, with discovered modifications (e.g. \"use reasonable defaults\" added to a prompt, sharper tool descriptions) generalizing to unseen examples.",

        blurb: "Lee et al. introduce Meta-Harness, an outer-loop system that searches over harness code for LLM applications. The agentic proposer has filesystem access to the source code, scores, and execution traces of all prior candidates, avoiding the aggressive feedback compression that the authors argue limits existing text optimizers in this setting. Reported results: +7.7 points over a state-of-the-art context management system on online text classification at 4x fewer context tokens; +4.7 points on average across five held-out models on 200 IMO-level retrieval-augmented math problems; and improved performance over hand-engineered baselines on TerminalBench-2 for agentic coding.",

        blurb: "Zhang et al. introduce hyperagents, self-referential agents that integrate a task agent and a meta agent into a single editable program in which the meta-level modification procedure is itself editable. The construction generalizes the Darwin Gödel Machine beyond coding-specific self-improvement: because the meta-level is no longer assumed to be aligned with any particular task domain, self-modification skill can in principle improve on arbitrary computable tasks. The authors report that DGM-Hyperagents outperforms prior self-improving systems across several domains and develops meta-level capabilities (persistent memory, performance tracking) that transfer across runs.",

          Coding agents are already exceeding human throughput for many software engineering tasks. As model capabilities continue to improve, agents will increasingly be the primary producers of code. The engineering challenge shifts: the bottleneck moves from writing code to ensuring that agent-produced code is correct, tested, coherent, and merge-ready, with as little human steering as possible.

        <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--body)", fontSize: "17px", lineHeight: 1.72, color: palette.body, maxWidth: "640px", marginBottom: "16px" }}>
          This course prepares you for that shift. You start by using a coding agent. Then you customise it. Then you learn disciplined workflows for complex codebases. And finally, you learn to design repositories built for agents: environments where teams of agents can do real work and do it right. We know this is new ground, so we explore several perspectives on what agent-first engineering could look like.
