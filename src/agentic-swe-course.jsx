          Coding agents are already exceeding human throughput for many software engineering tasks. As model capabilities continue to improve, agents will increasingly be the primary producers of code. The engineering challenge shifts: the bottleneck is no longer writing code but ensuring that agent-produced code is correct, tested, coherent, and merge-ready, with as little human steering as possible.

          This course prepares you for that shift. You start by using a coding agent. Then you customise it. Then you learn disciplined workflows for complex codebases. And finally, you learn to design repositories built for agents: environments where teams of agents can do real work and do it right. The industry calls this <strong style={{ fontWeight: 600, color: palette.text }}>harness engineering</strong>.
